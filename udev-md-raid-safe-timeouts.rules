# Set controller timeout for parent disk of each partition if the
# partition is a mdraid partition of higher than raid 0, and the disk
# doesn't have scterc turned on (i.e. if it's disabled or the disk
# doesn't support it). We determine if the disk has SCTERC turned on
# by examining the output of smartctl and seeing if it contains the
# word "seconds". If the word "seconds" is found we take this to imply
# STCERC is turned on, and take no action. Otherwise we set the drive
# controller timeout to 180 seconds. It would be better to check the
# exit status code of smartctl rather than grepping for "seconds", but
# it's not clear what that will be in the three cases (supported and
# turned on, supported but disabled, not supported).
