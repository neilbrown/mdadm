# Prerequisite:
# 1. The clustermd_tests/ cases only support to test 2-node-cluster, cluster
#    requires packages: 'pacemaker+corosync+sbd+crmsh', all packages link at
#    "https://github.com/ClusterLabs/", and also requires dlm resource running
#    on each node of cluster.
#    For quick start HA-cluster with SUSE distributions, refer to the chapter 6-8:
#    https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-12/install-quick/data/install-quick.html
#    For Redhat distributions, please refer to:
#    https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/high_availability_add-on_administration/index
# 2. Setup ssh-access with no-authorized mode, it should be:
#    # 'ssh $node1 -l root ls' and 'ssh $node2 -l root ls' success on any node.
# 3. Fill-up node-ip part and disks part as following.

# Set node1 as the master node, the cluster-md cases should run on this node,
# and node2 is the slave node.
# For example:
# NODE1=192.168.1.100 (testing run here)
# NODE2=192.168.1.101
NODE1=
NODE2=

# Provide the devlist for clustermd-testing, alternative: if set the step 1,
# don't set step 2, and vice versa.
# 1. Use ISCSI service to provide shared storage, then login ISCSI target via
#    to ISCSI_TARGET_ID and ISCSI_TARGET_IP on iscsi clients, commands like:
#    Execute on iscsi clients:
#    1) discover the iscsi server.
#    # iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p $ISCSI_TARGET_IP
#    2) login and establish connection.
#    # iscsiadm -m node -T $ISCSI_TARGET_ID -p $ISCSI_TARGET_IP -l
# Note:
#    On ISCSI server, must create all iscsi-luns in one target_id, recommend more
#    than 6 luns/disks for testing, and each disk should be: 100M < disk < 800M.
# 2. If all cluster-nodes mounted the same disks directly, and the devname are
#    the same on all nodes, then put them to 'devlist'.

# For example: (Only set $ISCSI_TARGET_ID is enough if iscsi has already connected)
# ISCSI_TARGET_ID=iqn.2018-01.example.com:clustermd-testing
# ISCSI_TARGET_IP=192.168.1.102
ISCSI_TARGET_ID=

#devlist=/dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
devlist=
