.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI mdassemble

.SH DESCRIPTION 
.B mdassemble
is a tiny program that can be used to assemble MD devices inside an
initial ramdisk (initrd) or initramfs, it is meant to replace the in-kernel
automatic raid detection and activation.
It can be built statically and linked against lightweight libc alternatives, like
.B dietlibc,
.B klibc
or
.B uClibc.

.SH USAGE
Invoking
.B mdassemble
has the same effect as invoking
.B mdadm --assemble --scan.

.SH OPTIONS

There are no options to
.B mdassemble.

.SH FILES

.SS /etc/mdadm.conf

The config file lists which devices may be scanned to see if
they contain MD super block, and gives identifying information
(e.g. UUID) about known MD arrays.  See
.BR mdadm.conf (5)
for more details.

.B mdassemble
supports all configuration parameters defined in
.B mdadm.conf
with the exception of
.B auto=
which is supported only if mdadm was built with the 
.B -DMDASSEMBLE_AUTO
define.
