/*
 * File: ReadMe.c
 *
 * This file contains general comments about the implementation
 * and the various usage messages that can be displayed by mdadm
 *
 */

/*
 * mdadm has 7 major modes of operation:
 * 1/ Create
 *     This mode is used to create a new array with a superblock
 * 2/ Assemble
 *     This mode is used to assemble the parts of a previously created
 *     array into an active array.  Components can be explicitly given
 *     or can be searched for.  mdadm (optionally) checks that the components
 *     do form a bona-fide array, and can, on request, fiddle superblock
 *     version numbers so as to assemble a faulty array.
 * 3/ Build
 *     This is for building legacy arrays without superblocks
 * 4/ Manage
 *     This is for doing something to one or more devices
 *     in an array, such as add,remove,fail.
 *     run/stop/readonly/readwrite are also available
 * 5/ Misc
 *     This is for doing things to individual devices.
 *     They might be parts of an array so
 *       zero-superblock, examine  might be appropriate
 *     They might be md arrays so
 *       run,stop,rw,ro,detail  might be appropriate
 *     Also query will treat it as either
 * 6/ Monitor
 *     This mode never exits but just monitors arrays and reports changes.
 * 7/ Grow
 *     This mode allows for changing of key attributes of a raid array, such
 *     as size, number of devices, and possibly even layout.
 * 8/ Incremental
 *     Is assembles an array incrementally instead of all at once.
 *     As devices are discovered they can be passed to "mdadm --incremental"
 *     which will collect them.  When enough devices to for an array are
 *     found, it is started.
