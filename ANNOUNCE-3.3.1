Subject: ANNOUNCE: mdadm 3.3.1 - A tool for managing md Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 3.3.1

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://github.com/neilbrown/mdadm
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://git.neil.brown.name/git/mdadm.git

The main changes are:
 - lots of work on "DDF" support.  Hopefully it will be more stable
   now.  Bug reports are always welcome.
 - improved interactions with 'systemd'.  Where possible, background
   tasks are run from systemd (if it is present) rather then forking
   disassociationg from the session.  This is important because udev
   doesn't really let you disassociate.

though there are a number of other little bug fixes too.
